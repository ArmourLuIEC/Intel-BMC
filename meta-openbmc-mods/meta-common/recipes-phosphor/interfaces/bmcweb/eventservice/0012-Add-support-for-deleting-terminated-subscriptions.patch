Subject: [PATCH] Add support for deleting terminated subscriptions

Added functionality to delete/remove event subscription(s) which are
configured to Terminate after retries.

Currently, when an Event is subscribed with Retry Policy as
"TerminateAfterRetries", the state of the connection is set to
"Terminated" after retrying, but the Subscription is not removed.
This commit adds the functionality to detect terminated connection and
remove the respective subscription.

This commit adds this check for metric reports.

Tested:
 - Created a Subscription with
   DeliveryRetryPolicy: "TerminateAfterRetries"
 - Received Events successfully on Event listener
 - Once the Event listener was stopped, the Subscription was
   removed/deleted after retries.
