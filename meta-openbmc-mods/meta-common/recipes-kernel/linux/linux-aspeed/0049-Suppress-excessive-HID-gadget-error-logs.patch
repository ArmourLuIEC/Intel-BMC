Subject: [PATCH] Suppress excessive HID gadget error logs

HID events can be sent even when the host disconnects the HID
device according to the current graphic mode. For an example, if
KVM mouse events are sent when the host is in text mode, queueing
of end point messages will be dropped with this message:

configfs-gadget gadget: usb_ep_queue error on int endpoint -108

This case is very usual case in BMC since BMC can control power
status of the host, so this commit suppress the error printing outs
with making HID gadget driver drop events quietly in the case.

This should be a downstream only customization. Do not upstream it.
